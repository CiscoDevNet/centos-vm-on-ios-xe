## Step 2. Enable serial service on the CentOS 7 VM

The Cisco Application Framework provides the option to connect to the VM console
from the IOS XE command line. To make this work, the serial service needs to be
enabled on the VM.

Enable the serial service on the CentOS 7 VM:
```
systemctl enable serial-getty@ttyS0.service
```

Start and verify the service is active:
```
systemctl start getty@ttyS0.service
systemctl status getty@ttyS0.service
```

#### Next Step: Configure CentOS 7 VM firewall
