## Step 10. Copy the IOx package to the Cisco device

The CAF/IOx framework on IOS XE will provide several interfaces to manage
the VM as described in the picture below:

In 16.8.1 only the CLI interface is available and that is what we are going to
use in this lab.

First of all you need to copy the IOx package (the tar file) to the device USB
device:

```
Cat9K# copy scp://fabri@10.10.249.121/centos.tar usbflash0: vrf Mgmt-vrf
```

NOTE: the package cannot be stored in the internal flash for security and
device integrity reasons. The front panel USB 2.0 can be used for testing and
prototyping while for production environments is recommended to use any SSD
storage option available in the given Catalyst 9000 platform (back panel USB 3.0
or M2 SATA).  

#### Next Step: Enable IOX on the Cisco IOS XE device
