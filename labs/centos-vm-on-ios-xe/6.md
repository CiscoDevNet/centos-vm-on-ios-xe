## Step 6. Learn the characteristics of an IOx package

At this point the VM is ready to be packaged!!

In order to be hosted on a Catalyst 9000 device the VM needs to be pre-packaged
in the IOx format.
An IOx package is a standard tar archive file that contains several files as
shown in the picture below:

* Storage: the VM (or LXC) File System
* Network: the VM virtual interfaces list
* HW Resources Descriptor: a text file with all the HW resources needed to run
  the VM on the Catalyst 9000
* Optional security certificates
