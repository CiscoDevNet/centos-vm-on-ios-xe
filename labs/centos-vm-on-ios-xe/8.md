## Step 8. Create the IOx package descriptor

As briefly described before, the HW Resources Descriptor is a text file with
all the HW resources needed to run the VM on the Catalyst 9000.

Create a file in the same directory as the qcow2 image, add the content below
and name it package.yaml

```
descriptor-schema-version: "2.3"

info:
  name: "Cisco IOx KVM Application based on CentOS 7 VM"
  description: "KVM  Application"
  version: "1.0"
  author-link: "http://www.cisco.com"
  author-name: "Cisco Systems"

app:
  # Indicate app type (vm, paas, lxc etc.,)
  type: vm
  cpuarch: "x86_64"
  resources:
    profile: custom
    cpu: 5000
    memory: 1024
    disk: 5
    vcpu: 2

    network:
      -
        interface-name: eth0

  # Specify runtime and startup
  startup:
    disks:
       -
        target-dev: "hdc"
        file: "centos7.qcow2"

```
As you can see, it includes VM info (i.e. name, description, author),
Application type (VM), HW resource (cpu, memory, disk), VM virtual network
interfaces and the VM file system (qcow2 image)

#### Next Step: Build the IOx package
