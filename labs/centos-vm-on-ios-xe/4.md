## Step 4. Configure proxy setting

If the Catalyst 9000 device does not have clear internet access and needs to go
through a proxy server, proxy server settings can be configured in the
~/.bash_profile like in the example below

```
export http_proxy="http://proxy.esl.cisco.com:80"
export https_proxy="https://proxy.esl.cisco.com:80"
```
