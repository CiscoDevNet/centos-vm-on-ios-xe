## Step 12. Configure the App

You need to configure at least one interface (vnic) per VM.
Both management port and up to 4 front panel data ports are supported.
In case of data ports, you need to configure a VPG (Virtual Port Group) as well.
The VPG will serve as default gateway for the container.

Example of configuration with Management port only:
```
app-hosting appid centos7
 vnic management guest-interface 0
```

Example with a data port:
```
Cat9k#conf t
Enter configuration commands, one per line.  End with CNTL/Z.
Cat9k(config)# interface VirtualPortGroup1
Cat9k(config-if)# ip address 10.151.1.1 255.255.255.0
Cat9k(config-if)# app-hosting appid centos7
Cat9k(config-app-hosting)# vnic gateway1 virtualportgroup 1 guest-interface 1
Cat9k(config-app-hosting)#end
```

For this lab let's keep it simple and use the management port only.

If a DHCP server is present in the same network, the VM will get automatically
an IP address.

Following is a simple configuration to enable a DHCP server on a device running
IOS:
```
ip dhcp excluded-address 10.10.249.1 10.10.249.229
ip dhcp pool lab
   network 10.10.249.0 255.255.255.0
   default-router 10.10.249.1
   dns-server 171.70.168.183
   domain-name cisco.com
```

The DHCP server will assign addresses to DHCP clients starting with the IP
address 10.10.249.230

#### Next Step: Install the IOx package
