## Step 15. (optional) Connect to the VM console and configure Networking

If you don't have a DHCP server or if you want to change the IP address, you can
connect to the VM from the IOS XE CLI using the serial service configured at the
very beginning of this lab, and follow the usual procedure to configure
networking on a CentOS 7 server.

To connect to the VM from the IOS XE CLI, use the CLI syntax below and provide
the VM username and password:
```
Cat9k#app-hosting connect appid centos7 console
Connected to appliance. Exit using ^c^c^c

CentOS Linux 7 (Core)
Kernel 3.10.0-693.el7.x86_64 on an x86_64

localhost login: root
Password:
Last login: Wed May 30 09:51:50 from 10.154.133.12
[root@localhost ~]#
```

Verify server ethernet interfaces.
If you recall from previous steps, we configured one VM virtual interface
using the command
```
vnic management guest-interface 0
```

The ending 0 is the interface number, so the VM should have an eth0 interface
only:
```
[root@localhost ~]# ls /sys/class/net
eth0  lo
```

Edit (or create) the eth0 interface configuration script file.
It should look like something like this:
```
[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0
TYPE=Ethernet
BOOTPROTO=none
NAME=eth0
DEVICE=eth0
ONBOOT=yes
DNS1=171.70.168.183
IPADDR=10.10.249.231
PREFIX=24
GATEWAY=10.10.249.1
```

Restart networking
```
[root@localhost ~]# systemctl restart network
```

Verify the eth0 interface is up and has the right IP and gateway configured:
```
[root@localhost ~]# ip addr
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
<snip>

2: eth0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:dd:bc:76:0c brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet 10.10.249.231/24 brd 10.10.249.255 scope global noprefixroute dynamic eth0
```

NOTE: ifconfig is not installed by default on CetntOS 7 minimal.
You can add it if needed:
```
yum install net-tools
```

#### Next Step: Verify VM is reachable from outside the device
