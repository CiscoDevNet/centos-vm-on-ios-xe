# How to build an CentOS 7 VM for Cisco IOS XE devices

Learn how to build and host a CentOS 7 VM on an IOS XE device

## Objectives

The objective of this lab is to show how to:

* build a CentOS 7 Virtual Machine (VM)
* package it in the Cisco Application Framework format, known as IOx (IOS + LinuX)
* host it on a network device running IOS XE like the Catalyst 9000

## Prerequisites

* A build server with a virtualization environment like Virtual Box or VMWare
  (ESXi or Fusion). Any Linux server or a Mac would be fine.
  The build server used as a reference is an Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS server
* A Cisco Catalyst 9000 device running IOS XE 16.8.1 with a front panel USB
  stick of 16GB or bigger. If you don't have a Catalyst 9000 device, you can
  leverage the DevNet Catalyst 9000 Sandbox. To reserve the sandbox:
  1. go to https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/
  2. click on Networking on the right pane
  3. select IOS XE on Catalyst 9000
  4. click Reserve and follow the instructions.
* A DHCP server or a static IP address for the VM

## Step 1. Build the CentOS7 VM

First of all you need to build the base CentOS 7 VM:
* Download CentOS 7 Minimal ISO installer from https://www.centos.org/download/
* Perform default installation making sure the networking is enabled
* Update all the packages using the yum update command:
```
yum -y update
```

#### Next Step: Enable serial service on the CentOS 7 VM
