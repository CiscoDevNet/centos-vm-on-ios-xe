## Step 14. Verify the VM status and details

Use the "sh app-hosting list" CLI to verify the VM has been installed and it is
in running state:
```
cat9k#sh app-hosting list
App id                           State
------------------------------------------------------
centos7                          RUNNING
```

Verify the VM details:
```
Cat9k#show app-hosting detail appid centos7
State                  : RUNNING
Author                 : Cisco Systems
Application
  Type                 : vm
  App id               : centos7
  Name                 : Cisco IOx KVM Application based on CentOS 7 VM
  Version              : 1.0
Activated profile name : custom
  Description          : KVM  Application
Resource reservation
  Memory               : 1024 MB
  Disk                 : 5 MB
  CPU                  : 5000 units
  VCPU                 : 2
Attached devices
  Type              Name        Alias
  ---------------------------------------------
  Serial/shell
  Serial/aux
  Serial/Syslog                 serial2
  Serial/Trace                  serial3

Network interfaces
   ---------------------------------------
eth0:
   MAC address         : 52:54:dd:9c:b3:05
   IPv4 address        : 10.10.249.231
Cat9k#
```

As you can see in the example above the info provided are the same as in the
package.yaml file descriptor plus some state info like the MAC address and the
IP address automatically assigned by the DHCP server.

#### Next Step: (optional) Connect to the VM console and configure Networking
