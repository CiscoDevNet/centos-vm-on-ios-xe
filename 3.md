## Step 3. Configure CentOS 7 VM firewall

The firewall service is enabled by default on CentOS.
Firewall rules need to be properly configured depending on the applications you
plan to install on the VM.
For this lab we are going to disable the firewall service:

```
systemctl disable firewalld
systemctl stop firewalld
```

Verify the service is not running anymore:
```
systemctl is-enabled firewalld
systemctl is-active firewalld
```

#### Next Step: Configure proxy setting
